# **Sales Prediction**

**I'm thrilled to share the successful completion of my final and last task (Task-5: Sales Prediction) during my Data Science journey at Oasis Infobyte ! 🚀**

**Key steps involved in this project:**

📈 Sales Prediction: This task revolved around predicting product sales, a crucial aspect of any business.

📊 Data Visualization and Correlation Analysis: I started by delving into the data, visualizing it to uncover patterns, and performing correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different variables.

🧪 Data Preprocessing: Preparing the data for modeling was essential. I conducted feature scaling, ensuring that the features were on a common scale for accurate predictions.

🚀 Model Training: I employed diverse machine learning techniques, including Linear Regression and Decision Tree models, to train on the prepared data.

📝 Evaluation Metrics: To assess the performance of our models, I used evaluation metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R²). These metrics provided insights into the accuracy and goodness-of-fit of our predictions.

📈 Sales Forecasting: Leveraging the trained models, I made sales predictions, offering valuable insights to optimize marketing strategies and maximize revenue.

🌟 Result: The culmination of Task-5 led to the development of accurate Sales Prediction models, empowering businesses to make data-driven decisions and enhance their sales strategies.
